Query Functions
Total Sales and Profit by Category
This aggregation query provides comprehensive category performance metrics. It calculates the total number of transactions, units sold, revenue generated, and profit earned for each product category. The query accounts for discounts when calculating revenue and profit figures. Additionally, it computes the average sale price per transaction after discounts are applied. Results are ordered by total revenue in descending order, highlighting the most financially successful categories.
Best Selling Products
This query ranks individual products by sales volume while providing detailed profitability metrics. For each product, it displays the product name, category, and retail price alongside calculated performance indicators including total units sold, total revenue (after discounts), total profit, and profit margin percentage. The profit margin is calculated as the difference between retail and cost price divided by retail price, expressed as a percentage. Products are ranked by total units sold in descending order, identifying the most popular items in the catalog.
